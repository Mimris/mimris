## Introduction to Modelling with Mimris

![Mimris Modeller](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d27506a0-4fa1-4d92-b783-f2f4eb65efc2)

A modelling language is an artificial, formal language designed to express data, information, or knowledge in a structured and consistent manner. Each modelling language adheres to a clearly defined set of rules that govern its syntax and semantics.

In Mimris, the modelling language is graphical in nature, providing a visual means of representing complex information and relationships.

### Understanding Metamodels

A metamodel is a model that defines the structure and semantics of a modelling language. In practice, the term metamodel is often used interchangeably with modelling language, although the metamodel technically describes the language rather than using it. This distinction is crucial for understanding how to create and utilize custom modelling languages within Mimris.

### Textual vs. Graphical Modelling Languages

In textual modelling languages, we typically speak in terms of nouns (entities) and verbs (actions or relationships). In a graphical modelling language such as Mimris, the corresponding terms are objects and relationships. This shift from textual to graphical representation allows for a more intuitive and visual approach to modelling complex systems.

### CORE_META: The Core of Custom Modelling

The modelling language used within Mimris to define new, custom modelling languages is called `CORE_META`. `CORE_META` provides a set of modelling primitives that enable users to define custom object types (analogous to nouns) and relationship types (analogous to verbs), along with associated properties and methods.

### Creating Custom Modelling Languages

Once these custom types are specified (modelled), users can invoke the ‚ÄúGenerate Metamodel‚Äù function to automatically produce their own metamodel. These metamodels‚Äîessentially new, domain-specific modelling languages‚Äîcan then be used as the foundation for creating custom models tailored to specific needs or contexts.

By leveraging `CORE_META`, users can develop highly specialized modelling languages that cater to the unique requirements of their projects, ensuring a more precise and effective modelling process.

### BPMN example model

The Mimris version of the BPMN Metamodel as shown below is rather advanced. 
It utilizes inheritance from an abstract object type (Gateway), relationships to and from the abstract type, in addition to relationships between non-abstract object types (Start, Task, End).  

![BPMN-Meta](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1cda36a-71e6-475e-8223-1b0a8a09b777)

In addition it utilizes the ‚Äútemplate2‚Äù field in the object and relationship views. This to achieve a completely different visualization of objects and relationships in the models built using the generated template than in the metamodel itself.

Below is shown an example model built using a template generated from the metamodel above.

  phFocus, // Current focus data. i.e. focusModel, focusModelview, focusObjectvieiw etx.
  phUser, // User preferences
  phSource, // Sourcefile (local or github)
  lastUpdate: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

## Diagram Engine

### GoJS Configuration

```typescript
// lib/gojsConfig.ts
import * as go from 'gojs';

export function initializeDiagram(): go.Diagram {
  const $ = go.GraphObject.make;
  
  return $(go.Diagram, {
    'undoManager.isEnabled': true,
    layout: $(go.ForceDirectedLayout),
    model: $(go.GraphLinksModel, {
      linkKeyProperty: 'key'
    })
  });
}

// Custom node template
export const nodeTemplate = (
  <Node
    locationSpot={go.Spot.Center}
    selectionAdorned={true}
  >
    <Shape 
      figure="Rectangle" 
      fill="#2F80ED" 
      strokeWidth={0}
    />
    <TextBlock 
      text="{name}" 
      margin={8} 
      stroke="white"
    />
  </Node>

# Mimris

Mimris is the tool for building Active Knowledge Models, a modelling tool with integrated Use-case Modeling and Meta-modelling capabilities.

Its build on some of the same concepts implemented I Metis (1985-2007) which was written in  C++. 
Mimris is written in JavaScript and TypeScript, using libraries like:  Next.js, React, Redux, Gojs ....

## The codebase


Mimris is a collection of functions and components written in TypeScript and React for this Modelling application.
There are two main code parts:

 1. Mimris code
 This code is JavaScript/TypeScript Object-oriented programming and is handling all Mimris modelling parts, i.e. the the model, modelview, object- relationship, objectview- relationshipview, and the integration with GOJS graphical  diagram library.
 The main principal for Mimris modelling is that the model has a collection of Objects and Relationships.
 Wi have modelviews that has collection of Objectviews and Reltationshipviews that refer to the Objects and Relationships. This means that and object can have many objectviews. These Objectviews can be in same or different Modelviews.

 1. The Frontend backend part, functional programmed handling the Single page App with integration with Redux store,  API's to GitHub, localStorage and the filesystem.
 To keep track of the state of the App, we have implemented a state focus object that set the focus/context of the current  situation lig current: model, modelview, object, objectview, relationship, relationshipview, current role and task, organisation and project.
 This means that when a Project file is loaded, the state will be set to current focus.
 This focus will be changed every time the user select an item in the modelling area (modelview)

 The functions and components are responsible for handling various tasks such as updating the properties of objects and relationships, handling events on the diagram, toggling tasks, dispatching data to the store, and loading data from local storage, local files or GigHub. 
 The code also includes functions for setting and updating the focus of the application, refreshing the objects, and handling the state of the application. Overall, the code is used to manage the state and behavior of the modeling application.
