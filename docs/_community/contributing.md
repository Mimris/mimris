Branch Strategy
Create a new branch from main:

git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

```
Use conventional branch prefixes:

feat/: New features
fix/: Bug fixes
docs/: Documentation
refactor/: Code improvements
💻 Development Workflow
Running the App
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build production bundle
npm run build
📐 Technology-Specific Guidelines
TypeScript
Strict mode enabled (strict: true in tsconfig)

All components must have TypeScript interfaces

Use generics with Redux hooks:

const dispatch = useAppDispatch<AppDispatch>();
Redux Toolkit
Create slices in src/store/features

Use RTK Query for API interactions

Follow this slice structure:

export const diagramSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'diagram',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addNode: (state, action: PayloadAction<Node>) => {
      // Immutable updates only
    }
  },
  extraReducers(builder) {
    // Add async reducers
  }
});

Next.js Pages
Client components in src/components
Dynamic routes follow [param]/page.tsx convention
documentation if needed

Include screenshots for UI changes

Describe changes in conventional commit format:

📚 Documentation
Updating Docs
Modify Markdown files in /docs
