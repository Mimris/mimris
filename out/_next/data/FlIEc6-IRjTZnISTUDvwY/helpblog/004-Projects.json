But if your intention is to build models for a specific purpose, you should start by giving the project a name and description that is meaningful to you. This is done by right clicking the background and select “Edit Project”. \nThen you are asked to enter a (new) project name and a description.\n\nIt is also recommended to change the model name (“*Edit Model*”) to a more meaningful name.\nYou do that by right clicking the background a select \"Edit Model\".\nThen you are asked to enter a (new) model name and a description.\n\nWhen the project and model naming is done, it is recommended to save the model to your local filesystem, which is done by clicking on the “File” button above the modelling window.
