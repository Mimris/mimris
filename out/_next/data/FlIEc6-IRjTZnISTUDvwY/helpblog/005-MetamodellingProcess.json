You drag “*EntityType*” into the modelling area and drop it to create an object representing your new type. You set the object name to the typename you decide. You do this for as many types you want. \nRelationship types are modelled as relationships of type “*relationshipType*” between “*EntityTypes*” in the model and renamed to the typename you decide.\n\n### The example\n\nIn this chapter we will use an example metamodel as defined below. It has four different object types, \"*Person*\", \"*House*\", \"*Apartment*\" and \"*Car*\", with relationship types \"*owns*\" and \"*rents*\" as shown in the next model diagram.\n\nThere are four “*EntityType*” objects, each representing an object type in the intended new metamodel. Their names are the planned object type names.\nThere are six “*isRelatedTo*” relationships, each representing a relationship type in the new metamodel. Each “*isRelatedTo*” relationship is renamed to its planned relationship type names. These are the names you see in the diagram.\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model031.png)\n\nThis small type definition model is enough to generate a new metamodel, that will allow you to model people, houses, apartments and cars, and link them together with the appropriate relationships. \n\n### Generate the metamodel\n\nThe first time you want to generate a metamodel from the type definition model, there are a few things you need to do:\n\n1. Create a new metamodel by right clicking the background and choose “***New Metamodel***” in the popup menu. You will be asked for a metamodel name.\n\n2. Generate the metamodel content by right clicking the background and choose “***Generate Metamodel***”. You will then be asked two questions:\n\n3. “***Do you want to include system types***”? At the time being answer “*No*” or “*Cancel*” to that question.\n\n4. “***Select Target Metamodel***”. In the dropdown list select the metamodel you created above and click \"*Done*\". You should then get the message: “*Target metamodel has been successfully generated!*”.\n\nNow it is time to verify your metamodel, to see if you are able to build the desired model based on the type definitions you just created.\n\n### Verify the metamodel\nTo do the verification create a new model based on your new metamodel and start modelling *persons*, *houses*, *apartments* and *cars*. \n\nYou create the new model by right clicking the background and choose “*New Model*” in the popup menu. You will be asked to select a metamodel – select the one you just generated.\n\nThen you will be asked for a model name and a modelview name. When the model has been created, switch to the model by selecting the model you just created in the pulldown dialog \"*Model:*\" ***in the top right corner of the AKMM window***. \n\nThe object types in the metamodel you created should now appear as object types in the left pane, and you should be ready to test that the metamodel you created works as expected. Create objects and relationships and do the verification as shown below. \n\nIf you can create objects of your 4 types, and connect relationships according to your type definitions, you have succeeded. \n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model0371.png)\n\n### Modify the metamodel\nIf something is wrong, or you want to change anything, go back to the type definition model, do the necessary changes, and generate the metamodel again.\n\nIf you want to add symbols and colors to your types, go back to your type definition model to add view specifications, and generate the metamodel again.\n\nThe view specifications are done by editing “*Object View*” of the “*EntityType*” objects and by editing “*Relationship View*” of the “*relationshipType*” relationships. \nThe “*Object View*” and “*Relationship View*” definitions are used to define the corresponding “*Object Typeview*” and “*Relationship Typeview*” definitions in the generated metamodel.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
