The reason for doing so may vary. \nOne reason may be to have views of different levels of detail, such as showing high level concepts in one modelview, and detailed views of the different concepts in separate modelviews. \nAn example of this would be to focus on object and relationship types in one modelview and types with their properties in a second modelview. \n\nIn another situation, if you have a large model covering separate areas such as business or technical, it would be natural to use different modelviews for the separate areas.\n\nWhat to remember is, if the same object appears in two or more modelviews, you should do a “Copy” in the first modelview and do a “Paste View” in the second modelview. \nThe same applies if you want the same object-relationship structure to appear in different modelviews. Do a “*Copy*” in the first modelview followed by a “*Paste View*” in the second. \n\n### Create modelview\n\nYou create a modelview by choosing “*New Modelview*” in the popup menu on the background. And you can do “*Edit Modelview*” if you want to change the name or the description. \n\nIf you have several modelviews they will be sorted by their names. If you want a specific sequence, you may let the first part of the name be a number. In that way you can control the sequence.\n\n### Layout customization\n\nIn each modelview you can specify:\n\n    -\tautomatic layout\n    -\trouting and curve\n    -\tshow cardinality on/off\n\nThere are a few built-in layout algorithms that you can choose to use if you want:\n\n    -\t“Circular” layout\n    -\t“Grid” layout\n    -\t“Tree” layout\n    -\t“ForceDirected” layout\n    -\t“LayeredDigraph” layout\n\nThe default is “*Manual*” layout.\nIt is recommended that you test the different layout algorithms to see if any suits your need.\n\nYou can also define different kinds of “*Routing*”. The alternatives are:\n \n    -\t\"Normal\"\n    -\t\"Orthogonal\"\n    -\t\"Avoids Nodes\"\n \n“*Normal*” means straight lines, as shown in most examples in this document.\n\nIn addition to routing, you can define something called “*Curve*”, with allowed values:\n\n    -\t\"None\"\n    -\t\"Bezier\"\n    -\t\"Jump Over\"\n    -\t\"Jump Gap\"\n\nBelow you can see how a diagram changes appearance with different combination of the above, and we start with the defaults:\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model008.png)\n\nThen with “*Curve*” set to “*Bezier*”:\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model009.png)\n\nThe next example has the following parameters:\n    -\t“*Routing*” has been set to “*Orthogonal*”\n    -\t“*Curve*” has been set to “*Jump Over*”\n\nNote the two relationships that cross each other, how they are drawn in the diagram.\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model010.png)\n\nThe same as above, except that “*Curve*” has been set “*Jump Gap*”. Note the difference.\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model011.png)\n\nThe last thing to mention regarding modelviews is the ability to turn the visibility of cardinality on and off. You do this from the background menu: \n\n-\tToggle Cardinality On/Off\n\nBelow is an example of a product metamodel that you will meet later in this document. The “*Toggle Cardinality*” has been set to “*On*”:\n\n![alt text](/images/posts/modelling/image_model011.png)\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
