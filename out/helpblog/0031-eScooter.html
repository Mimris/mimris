    Test Solution Model?
    </summary>

<p>A test Solution Model is a model that is used to test the Concept Model and the generated Metamodel.
The purpose of the test model is to &quot;instanciate&quot; the Concepts and create examples to test if the Concept Model is working as expected.
If changes are needed, we go back to the Concept Model and make the changes necessary and regenerate the metamodel for a new test.</p>
<p>If we are satisfied, we can export the type definitions to i.e. GraphQL typedefinition file and create Queries / Mutations from the Tasks.</p>

<h3 id="concept-model-overview">Concept Model overview</h3>
<p>We start with a current concept model of the rental service. The user can locate and rent an e-Scooter for a period of time. The user will release the e-Scooter for others to use at the end of the period. 
A Model consists of a set of objects and relationships between these objects. This Model is a <strong>Concept Model</strong> wich consists of a set of objecttypess and relationshiptypes.
The model can have several Modelviews. Each modelview is a set of objectviews and relationshipviews that is used to display sertain aspects of the model.</p>
<p>The modelview (picture below) contains the object/information types needed in a rental service for E-scooters. 
In the &quot;Type definition&quot; container at the right you se currently defined Objecttypes Types: &quot;<strong>Person</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Company</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Fleet</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Location</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Vehicle</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>EScooter</strong>&quot;, with Relationship Types &quot;<strong>has</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>contains</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>In the left container we have the predefined (from IRTV-metamodel ) objects <strong>Role</strong> and <strong>Tasks</strong> used for the rental service.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escooter/image_020-1.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>A person fills the role of User that performs the task of renting an E-scooter.
The person has a position (coordinates) which is used to determine the location where to search for nearby E-scooters.
The rental service is based on the concept of a fleet of E-scooters.
The fleet is a collection of vehicles which consists of E-scooters.</p>

<p>Below we see the definition of the properties and relationships for the <strong>Person</strong>, and <strong>Vehicle</strong> in a new Modelview.</p>
<p>Vehicle also has a relationship to <strong>Position</strong> objecttype, that contains the GPS coordinates of the vehicle.
On the right side of the modelview we see some of the datatype definition for the properties. The default datatype is &quot;String&quot;.</p>
