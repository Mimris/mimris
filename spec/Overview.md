# AKM Modeller

    From ChatGPT:
    The Active Knowledge Modelling (AKM) methodology is the foundation for a more agile approach to solutions based on adaptive design methods and evolutionary IT infrastructures. Using AKM methods project workers and service providers can adapt, extend, and reconfigure solutions and services for innovative cyclic design and sustainable life-cycle support and knowledge reuse and management. 

    The AKM methodology is based on adaptive design methods and evolutionary IT infrastructures. The AKM models are new solution components extending traditional ICT systems to involve practitioners and pragmatic enterprise knowledge models and workspaces.

    The AKM approach has been applied by manufacturing industries and consultants to implement pragmatic and powerful design platforms

## Scope and Requirements

### Target audience

The target audience in the short term is Enterprise Architects and Knowledge workers that want to develop a up-to-date, flexible and functional Architecture model, defining necessary Information, Roles, Tasks and Views for a certain Domain.

the target audience, in the longer term, is Knowledge workers and Users who want to adust and update and enhance their current Apps and Systems on a continuous basis, integrating the metamodelling, solution modelling and execution in a cyclic change and updating.
 
### Features and functionality

Main features is to help users to develop Knowledge Models, with reflective Metamodels and Models, from Scaffolding models, via Type definition Models, generated Metamodels that can be used to develop Solutions Models and then generate/configure Solutions.
