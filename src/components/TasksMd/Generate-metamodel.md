#### Generate the new Metamodel
 

Generate the metamodel content by Right-Click the Metamodel object and choose “***Generate Metamodel***”. 

In the appearing dialog "Select Target Metamodel",
select the Default Metamodel

You should then get the message: “***The metamodel "name" has been successfully generated!***”.

Check the generated metamodel in the Target Metamodel pallet to the right (blue pane)

Now it is time to verify your metamodel, to see if you are able to build the desired model based on the type definitions you just created.
