# GPT Prompt Guides and Examples

## Guides

1. Creating a good prompt for GPT models involves clear instructions, relevant context, and a well-defined goal. Here's a step-by-step guide to crafting an effective prompt:

1. Define your goal: Determine the specific information or output you want from the model. This could be an answer to a question, a creative text, or a solution to a problem.

1. Provide context: Give the model enough background information to understand the topic and generate a relevant response. This may include definitions, examples, or explanations.

1. Be clear and concise: Use simple, straightforward language to convey your instructions. Avoid ambiguity and ensure that your prompt is easy to understand.

1. Specify the format: If you have a preferred format for the response, make it clear in the prompt. This could include specifying the number of paragraphs, bullet points, or any other structural elements.

1. Ask for reasoning or elaboration: If you want the model to provide explanations or justifications for its response, include a request for this in the prompt.

1. Set boundaries: If there are any limitations or constraints you want the model to adhere to, mention them explicitly. This could include word count, avoiding certain topics, or adhering to specific guidelines.

1. Proofread and revise: Review your prompt for clarity, grammar, and punctuation. Make any necessary revisions to ensure it is well-written and easy to understand.

Example of a good prompt:

"Please provide a brief summary of the main causes of the French Revolution, including the role of the monarchy, economic factors, and social inequality. Limit your response to three paragraphs, and include at least one example for each cause."

This prompt is effective because it clearly defines the goal, provides context, specifies the format, and asks for examples to support the response.
