<!-- ## Using GitHub

Using GitHub to store your model projects.

Because the Project model files are Json-files, you can also store your model projects in GitHub repository.
Create a repository in GitHub and add a folder were you can store your model files.
Clone the repository to your local computer and open and save your model project file from you local repository as described above.

When you have savee your project, you can **Add, Commit and Push** your repository to GitHub as normal. -->
