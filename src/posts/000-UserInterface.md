# Introduction

The AKM Modeller (AKMM) is a generic platform for developing and utilizing knowledge models. 
It can be customized to support any subject area, if the area can be described by entities of different types and by relationships between those types. Both entities and relationships may be described by relevant properties and associated methods.

The user interface is implemented as a graphic modelling environment where each concept is visualized graphically to ease communication between users. The visualization of objects and relationships is customizable.


# Concepts

The models in AKMM are organized in Projects, as shown in the figure below.
