## Introduction  

The OSDU (Open Subsurface Data Universe) Data platform, contains Schemas,  a set of standardized data definitions and Object types with properties and relationsips, that is used when ingesting data into or extracting data from the platform. 

The core functionality of this module, consists of the ability to import and export Json files according to these definitions. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format, and has become a popular standard format for exchanging data between applications. Even if JSON is human readable, it is not easy to see and identify the relationships between the data (Json-files). This AKM module provides a way to import and export OSDU Json files from/to AKM models.

The AKM model presents the complex Json-file structure and relatioships between the ObjectTypes in a user firendly graphical and a more understandable and concise way.

This makes it easy to edit and expand the Metamodels to embrace new product categories. The Object types are enhanced and expanded by adding new properties and relationships. The new enhanced models can then be exported as Json-files for import into the OSDU Data platform.

## Extensions of the IRTV Metamodel



To generate a metamodel from this model, right-click on the background and choose **Generate Metamodel** command. 
A dialog-box will appear asking "Do you want to include system types". Click Ok to include system types. 
A new dialog-box will appear where you can select which metamodel you want to generate.


(Note: A metamodel has to exist before you can generate a metamodel from a concept model.  On the background menu choose **New Metamodel** to create a new metamodel.)
