PS! Check the name in “Save As: field”. Sometimes it suggests wrong name (not the one you just typed in).  
This is a known bug; we are working to fix it.  
You can Exit the dialog and Click” Save to local file” again, and now it should suggest the correct name.

- -Then Click “Exit” to close the dialog-window
