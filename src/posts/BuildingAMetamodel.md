## The Metamodel

In this chapter the focus is on the technicalities associated with developing models of metamodels, generating metamodels, creating models based on the generated metamodel and then start over again by making changes in the metamodel design.

When you start AKM Modeller, an initial model using a initial metamodel is opened.

The left pane above contains the object types in the initial metamodel, which  user can be used to build a model. 
A model can have different purposes, for example, a model can be used to generate a new metamodel. This is often called a concept model.
