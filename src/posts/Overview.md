# Introduction

 

The AKM Modeller (AKMM) is a generic platform for developing and utilizing knowledge models. It can be customized to support any subject area, if the area can be described by entities of different types and by relationships between those types. Both entities and relationships may be described by relevant properties and associated methods.

The user interface is implemented as a graphic modelling environment where each concept is visualized graphically to ease communication between users. The visualization of objects and relationships is customizable.

 
The Modeller differentiates between a meta-model (a modelling language) and a model. The meta-model defines the object types and relationship types - e.g. may Person and Car be your object types, while owns or rents may be your relevant relationship types between those object types. Based on such a meta-model you may build a model of actual persons and cars and connect the relationships between the persons and their cars.
