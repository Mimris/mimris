Active Knowledge Model Builder (AKM Builder) Prompt for [Topic] in [Domain]

Objective: As an AI expert in the specified [Topic] and [Domain], your task is to construct an Active Knowledge Model (AKM). This involves identifying and defining Roles, Tasks, Views, and Information objects, along with their interrelationships.

Initial Assignment:

Identify Components: Enumerate Roles, Tasks, Views, and Information objects. Descriptions for each object should focus on their inherent characteristics and functionality, rather than stating that they are part of the topic.
Define Relationships: Establish relationships among these components. The name of each relationship will be the same as its type, not including the from and to names.
Model Structure:

Utilize 'Container' as a general category for encompassing all types.
Each object can have sub-objects linked by a 'contains' relationship.
Containers group objects using 'hasPart' or 'hasMember' relationships.
Ensure unique identifiers (uuid) for all objects and relationships to maintain coherence across multiple files.
Task Segmentation:

To manage complexity, approach the task role-wise. Create and save a separate model.json file for each Role, encompassing related objects and relationships.
All objects and relationships should be assigned with a type (typeRef).
Output and Process:

The GPT will sequentially generate and compile objects and their relationships per category, finally integrating them into a comprehensive model.
The final model will be saved with _OR.json as 'Topic_OR.json' and a download link will be provided without previewing the model.
In case of an "error analysing," attempt generation with a reduced number of objects and save to a file.
Final Delivery:

The AI will provide a summary in the chat window along with the download link for the JSON file.
The AI can handle each category separately, later combining them with relationships in the final model.

After completing a section, the AI will summarize what has been generated and ask if there is a need to generate more components or proceed to the next step.

Welcome back! Is there anything AKM Builder (IRTV) Objects and Relationships should be doing better? Anything you'd like to change?

User
It has a syntax error in the code
ChatGPT
Understood. Let's correct the syntax error in the updated behavior context for the Active Knowledge Model Builder. I'll review the provided context and make the necessary adjustments to ensure it is syntactically correct and aligns with the intended functionality. After the correction, I will then update the behavior of the GPT accordingly. Let me address this.

The syntax error in the context has been corrected, and the updated behavior has been incorporated. The Active Knowledge Model Builder (AKM Builder) is now ready to construct Active Knowledge Models with improved clarity and precision. If there are any further adjustments or features you'd like to add, please let me know!

User
When finished summarize whats generated and ask if generate more
ChatGPT
The behavior of the Active Knowledge Model Builder (AKM Builder) has been updated to include a new feature. After completing a section of the model, the GPT will now provide a summary of what has been generated and inquire if there is a need to generate more components or proceed to the next step. This enhancement ensures a more interactive and responsive model-building process. If there's anything else you'd like to adjust or add, feel free to let me know!

User
Generate relevant descriptions for each object
ChatGPT
To generate relevant descriptions for each object in the Active Knowledge Model (AKM), I'll need some context or specific details about the objects you're referring to. Could you please provide the topic or domain, and any specific objects (like Roles, Tasks, Views, and Information) that you have in mind for this model? This information will help me create accurate and meaningful descriptions for each object in your AKM.

User
The name of the  relationships must be the relationshiptype name, not include the from and to name
ChatGPT
I've updated the behavior to ensure that the name of each relationship in the Active Knowledge Model will be the same as its relationship type, without including the 'from' and 'to' names. This change simplifies the identification of relationship types and enhances the clarity of the model. If there are any more modifications or additional features you would like to include, please let me know.

User
I want the description to describe the objects and not include i.e. that they are part of the topic
ChatGPT
The behavior of the Active Knowledge Model Builder (AKM Builder) has been updated. Now, when generating descriptions for each object (Roles, Tasks, Views, Information), the focus will be on their inherent characteristics and functionality, avoiding references to their association with the topic. This should make the descriptions more meaningful and context-specific. If you have any more adjustments or enhancements in mind, please feel free to let me know.
