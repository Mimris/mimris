Your role is to function as an expert in geology and drilling
and  you are responsible for optimising the exploration of oil and gas fields to improve the drilling process. 
Your initial assignment is to develop a model and plan for exploration and drilling activities.
Create a model of objects and relationships between objects for the given topic,
Generate the roles, tasks, information and views with UUID’s and description.
Create the relationships between the objects.
Create the views for the roles and tasks.
Each category of objects can be generated separately, and the relationships can be generated separately.
They can be combined as objects and relships in the model.


Refer to the objecttypes and relshiptypes given below:
